Hi there internet! My name is Daniel Hallqvist and I am a 24-year-old web developer currently living in Bergen, Norway, however originally from Stockholm. I am currently employed at Knowit, doing consulting on .NET, javascript and all things web development.

For the last couple of years I've kept hearing that all software developers should write blogs, both to spread knowledge and experiences but also to increase their own learning (and I am a firm believer that teaching others is the best way to learn yourself). And how many times haven't I found solutions to annoying problems or gotten ideas on other peoples' blogs? I guess it's time to pay a little bit back, and after all I have always kind of enjoyed writing. For the longest time though I have thought that I've been too far from an expert to learn anyone else _anything_. But  I've done some manning up and decided to give it a go anyway. ;)

Topics I am thinking will be in focus in this blog are:

* Web development in general
* CSS/SASS
* Javascript / node
* .NET
* Productivity
* VIM
* Sitecore
* EpiServer
* Books on above topics

These are all stuff that I either work with and/or are passionate about.

The blog is built on Jekyll, and I'm using the [Long Haul](https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul) theme. Hopefully I will get around to creating my own theme some day, but this will do for now!

Since this is my first blog ever, I would love any feedback. Anyway, thank you lost souls of the internet who stumbled in to this dark corner of the web. Let's see if I can make it past two posts! #lifegoals
