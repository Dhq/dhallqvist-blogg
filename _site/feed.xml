        <title>Hello world</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there internet! My name is Daniel Hallqvist and I am a 23-year-old web developer currently living in Bergen, Norway, however originally from Stockholm. I am currently employed at Knowit, doing consulting on .NET, javascript and all things web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of years I’ve kept hearing that all software developers should write blogs, both to spread knowledge and experiences but also to increase their own learning (and I am a firm believer that teaching others is the best way to learn yourself). And how many times haven’t I found solutions to annoying problems or gotten ideas on other peoples’ blogs? I guess it’s time to pay a little bit back, and after all I have always loved to write. For the longest time though I have thought that I’ve been too far from an expert to learn anyone else &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. But thanks to all the inspirational people on the internet, I’ve decided to give it a go anyway. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enough justifying the decision to create this blog, let me tell you what you can expect. The experts say that you should narrow down the theme of the blog, find your niche in the blogosphere of developers… So let’s do the exact opposite! No, not really, but I think that if I narrowed it down too much it would end up with me not producing any posts, and god knows if I make it past two blog posts anyway. I think people can expect to primarily find posts about web development, javascript, .NET and CSS. I also do a bunch of development on CMS systems at work, such as Episerver and Sitecore, so there might be posts about those as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog is built on Jekyll, and I’m using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul&quot;&gt;Long Haul&lt;/a&gt; theme. Hopefully I will get around to creating my own theme some day, but this will do for now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is my first blog ever, I would love any feedback. Anyway, thank you lost souls of the internet who stumbled in to this dark corner of the web. Let’s see if I can make it past two posts! #lifegoals&lt;/p&gt;
