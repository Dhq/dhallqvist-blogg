	<p>I am 24-year-old swedish web developer, living in Bergen. I am currently employed at Knowit, where I consult on .NET, Episerver, Sitecore, javascript and all things web.
	Other than that I am a bit too fond of tooling and fiddling with my .vimrc. </p>
	<p> This blog is also a place for me to work on my writing, english and to document things I'm trying to learn as I go to increase the learning process. 
	Hopefully, someone will find <em>something</em> useful here as well! </p>
