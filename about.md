	<p>I am 23-year-old swedish web developer, currently living in Bergen. I am currently employed at Knowit, where I consult on .NET, Episerver, Sitecore, javascript and all things web. Don't be surprised if this blog revolved around those mentioned topics as well. This blog is also a place for me to work on my writing, english and to document things I'm trying to learn as I go to increase the learning process. Hopefully, someone will find <em>something</em> useful here as well! </p>
